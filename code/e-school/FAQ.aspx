                    <strong></strong>Every top-industrialist’s family, successful lawyers, technocrats
                    and professionals send their children to the best of residential schools. There
                    are many who have never been to colleges but are running millions worth business
                    with top professionals working for them. The secret is their tremendous self-confidence,
                    decision making ability and leadership qualities.

                    A child’s overall development, education, personality development, leadership qualities
                    and rich values and culture will be the deciding factor for real success in life.
                    Every child is bestowed with these latent potentialities which remain suppressed
                    due to over-protection of parental care. Every decision is taken by the parent for
                    the child. We love our children too much and cannot afford to make any mistake by
                    allowing children to take independent decision. This is where quality residential
                    schools offer good multi-platform for developing his personality and leadership
                    traits.

                    span of time, the day school can only cater to academics and syllabi completion
                    as it is so vast. Emphasis on personality development is neither planned nor possible.

                    <strong></strong>No proper system is present at home to cater to personality development
                    of the child. Our love for our children is far too much and for reasons known, we
                    tend to be over-protective about them. In this process, we unknowingly cause more
                    harm than help as the latent potentials get submerged. Children reciprocate to our
                    love but value the words of teachers more than the parents. The most important period
                    of development of the child is between the age of 8 to 18 years and this vital period
                    after school time till bedtime has been let slightly loose and this is certainly
                    not the correct for the child who is the most priceless asset with us.

                    Residential Schools adopt a “whole-life” approach to education wherein the curriculum
                    is not only person-centered but community oriented also. The curriculum of a residential
                    school is designed to cater to the individual needs and interests of the children
                    keeping in mind their future welfare. Best qualities of family life are replicated
                    in the lifestyle of the boarders and the quest for personal fulfilment is balanced
                    by a commitment of shared endeavour, it adds dimensions of self-confidence, tolerance
                    and maturity while imparting knowledge. Residential schools strengthen the will
                    power of the students and help them to build a strong character. It provides them
                    with the opportunity to understand the meaning and virtue of discipline.</p>

                <p align="justify">
                    <strong></strong>Eminent psychologists like Edward Thorndike and Sigmund Frued opine
                    that a child needs immense parental care till the age of eight as emotional stability
                    is nurtured in the child during this stage. The qualities and emotional balance
                    can be instilled by the parents during this age only.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The right age for children to join residential schools is 9, wherein the child has
                    developed the sense of responsibility and self-confidence and has the ability to
                    handle testing situations. Residential School helps a child to develop into independent
                    mature adults enabling them to adjust to all types of situations and environment
                    later in life.</p>

                    imbibe values because values are not taught but demonstrated. We have listed 75
                    Human Values to groom the children, wherein all the students are supposed to pick
                    up any one value and make projects and presentation on the same.
